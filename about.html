Chefs for Peace is a non-profit, non-political organization founded in the Holy City of Jerusalem in November 2001 by a group of Jewish, Christian and Muslim chefs committed to exploring cultural identity, diversity and coexistence through food. 

Chefs for Peace understands food - its preparation, sharing, and enjoyment - as a powerful means of creating a bond with others and revealing that which is valued by all three faiths: food, family and friends.

Chefs For Peace is indifferent to politics, religion, or skin color. Our aim is to bring people together; we understand the power of food as a bridge to mutual acceptance and see peace as a delicious possibility. Our message is simple: only real people living and working together, not politicians, will create peace on the ground. For us, peace happens every day, in the kitchen and around the table!
